# Shermod-extruder
Modded Sherpa for better fit BMG gearset clones.

Modded Sherpa mini extruder to nicely fit cloned gearsets.
Many gearsets heve problem with main gear that should be manually modded.
With this Extruder cloned gears should fit without modding. 
Changed also to Voron standard heatsets and motor is littlebit pushed to front. 
Modified also for reverse bowden with pressed ECAS04 connectors.
